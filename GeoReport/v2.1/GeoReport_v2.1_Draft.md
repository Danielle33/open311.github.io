`This is a fork of the GeoReport v2 spec documentation for use in drafting a v2.1 version of the spec. Use the `[`Mailing` `List`](http://lists.open311.org/groups/discuss)` for discussion.`

The GeoReport API allows developers to build applications to report non-emergency issues such as graffiti, potholes, and street cleaning directly to government organizations like cities.

Status
------

### Specification

<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">In Development:</span> The GeoReport v2.1 Spec is currently being drafted

Service Discovery
-----------------

GeoReport v2 and subsequent Open311 APIs are also required to have a standard service discovery file associated with them to provide routing between versions and types of APIs. See the [Service Discovery](/Service_Discovery "wikilink") page for details of the specification.

Internationalization and Encoding
---------------------------------

### Date/time format

All date/time fields must be formatted in a common subset of ISO 8601 as per the [w3 note](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). Timezone information (either Z meaning UTC, or an HH:MM offset from UTC) **must** be included.

Examples:

-   1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00 corresponds to November 5, 1994, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Time.
-   1994-11-05T13:15:30Z corresponds to the same instant.

### Encoding

UTF-8 is required everywhere.

All text returned by the service, whether in XML, JSON, or any other text-based content-type, MUST be encoded as UTF-8. Appropriate HTTP headers must be set, and the root element must be preceded with the XML declaration including the encoding="UTF-8" attribute. All text received by the service from the client will be assumed to be UTF-8 and must be decoded accordingly. Examples of the HTTP content-type headers for each format are shown below under Format Support.

Format Support
--------------

XML is a required format, but JSON can be provided at the discretion of the API provider. The output formats supported by the provider are indicated through the [Service Discovery](/Service_Discovery "wikilink") formats field for the API endpoint being used. The client can specify the desired format by appending the format name to the resource. For example a GET request to /services.xml for text/xml output from the services resource and /services/01.json for application/json ([RFC 4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt)) output for a specific service definition.

The HTTP content-type headers should look like this for each format:

**POST Service Request:** Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8

**XML:** Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8

**JSON:** Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

### XML Support

XML for the API should be Content-Type: text/xml. The XML output currently defined is schemaless and without a namespace declaration. For now, extending the output with additional namespaces should be done at your own risk. To guarantee that all clients can support the XML output, it is recommended that you adhere to the specification strictly and do not include foreign tags or namespaces. It is also assumed that the default namespace is not specified, but if it must be specified, the XMLNS URI is the URL of the specification: <http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2>

### JSON Support

JSON for the API should be Content-Type: application/json. JSON support is based on a programmatic mapping of the XML format using the [Spark Convention](http://wiki.open311.org/JSON_and_XML_Conversion#The_Spark_Convention). This means that if you have an XML file, you can easily generate the JSON version with XSL. This can be done using a server side XSLT ([php example](http://sandbox.georeport.org/tools/sparkjson/xml2json_spark_php.txt)).

Definitions
-----------

#### jurisdiction_id

As a means to allow this API to distinguish multiple jurisdictions within one API endpoint we've included a "jurisdiction_id" which will be the unique identifier for cities. It has been suggested that we use the jurisdiction's main website root url (without the www) as the "jurisdiction_id". For San Francisco, the jurisdiction_id is sfgov.org. Implementations can ignore this parameter and treat it as an "Optional Argument" if the implementation only serves one jurisdiction.

#### Optional Arguments

"Optional" means that the response should be the same whether a parameter is passed and is empty or is not passed at all. A null parameter should be treated as equivalent to a non-declared parameter in processing the request.

Otherwise, this is free form text limited to 4,000 characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| media_url        | A URL to media associated with the request, eg an image.                                                 | A convention for parsing media from this URL has yet to be established, so currently it will be done on a case by case basis much like Twitter.com does. For example, if a jurisdiction accepts photos submitted via Twitpic.com, then clients can parse the page at the Twitpic URL for the image given the conventions of Twitpic.com. This could also be a URL to a media RSS feed where the clients can parse for media in a more structured way.                                      |
| media             | An array of file uploads                                                                                 | A client may POST multiple files as multipart/form-data. This is the equivalent of having multiple <input type="file" name="media[]" /> inputs. Subsequent calls for GET Service Requests should return the URL for this file via the media_urls field. This means that a client can not simultaneously post a URL for media_url and post files via media. If this is done, the files uploaded via the media field will take precedence and be returned as URLs in the media_url field. |

For example, if a jurisdiction accepts photos submitted via Twitpic.com, then clients can parse the page at the Twitpic URL for the image given the conventions of Twitpic.com. This could also be a URL to a media RSS feed where the clients can parse for media in a more structured way. |

For example, if a jurisdiction accepts photos submitted via Twitpic.com, then clients can parse the page at the Twitpic URL for the image given the conventions of Twitpic.com. This could also be a URL to a media RSS feed where the clients can parse for media in a more structured way. |

#### Possible Errors

The numbers represent the HTTP status code returned for each error type:

-   404 - jurisdiction_id not found (specified in error response)
-   400 - jurisdiction_id was not provided (specified in error response)
-   400 - General Service error (Any failure during service query processing. Client will have to notify us)

| error ↴       |
| code          | The error code representing the type of error. In most cases, this should match the HTTP status code returned in the HTTP header. |                      |
| description   | A human readable description of the error that occurred. This is meant to be seen by the user.                                    |                      |

-   **General Errors**
    -   403 - Missing or Invalid API Key (specify in error message)
    -   400 - The URL request is invalid or open311 service is not running or reachable. Client should notify us after checking URL

HTTP error codes are required, but the code in the response body shouldn't necessarily match the HTTP error code, so that more specific and unique error code identifiers can be used. The HTTP error codes should always be 404 for resources that don't exist, 403 for errors because of wrong or missing api_key and basically 400 for any other error where the request can not be fulfilled as expected. Multiple errors codes and descriptions can be returned in the body (the response is an array).

    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <errors>
