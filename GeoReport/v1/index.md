Open 311 API
============

Description
-----------

The Open311 API allows developers to build applications to report non-emergency issues such as graffiti, potholes, and street cleaning directly to government organizations like cities. The following organizations have adopted this API and allow access:

Servers (can receive reports)
-----------------------------

<onlyinclude>

Servers receive and manage reports on behalf of a jurisdiction.

*Note that the URLs require a method and jurisdiction_id at the end, the root URL is not intended to be accessed directly.*

### city_id

As a means to allow this API to be used by multiple cities we've included a "city_id" which will be the unique identifier for cities. It has been suggested that we use the city's url as the "city_id". We have incorporated that suggestion into our design and the city_id for San Francisco = sfgov.org

Query Service Requests
----------------------

Methods to query services requests have not yet been integrated into the spec. For now there are different options for different cities. Both San Francisco and Washington D.C. provide KML files of all service requests. San Francisco also provides a separate web service for service requests.

#### San Francisco

-   [KML](http://apps.sfgov.org/datafiles/index.php?dir=311)
-   [Guide to RESTful XML Web Service](http://apps.sfgov.org/datafiles/view.php?file=311/webservice.txt)

#### Washington D.C.

-   [KML](http://data.octo.dc.gov/feeds/src/src_current.kml)
-   [XML feed](http://data.octo.dc.gov/feeds/src/src_current.xml)
-   [Custom query](http://data.octo.dc.gov/NewCalendar.aspx?datasetid=4) also provides Shapefile export
-   [Plain text .zip](http://data.octo.dc.gov/feeds/src/src_current_plain.zip)
-   [Excel CSV](http://data.octo.dc.gov/feeds/src/src_current_csv.zip)
-   [Guide to Metadata](http://data.octo.dc.gov/Metadata.aspx?id=4)
