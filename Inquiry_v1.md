Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) are questions (with their corresponding answers) that are posted as part of 311 online.

The FAQ functionality consists of two methods. The first method, “Get Frequently Asked Questions List”, retrieves a list of FAQs when invoked. The second method, “Get Frequently Asked Question”, retrieves detailed information about a specific FAQ when invoked.

Get Frequently Asked Questions List
-----------------------------------

This method retrieves a list of links to all FAQs and a brief description of each question. This method takes a category or a type as an optional input. If a category is provided, the list of Services returned will be restricted such that only FAQs which belong to that category will be included in the response.
